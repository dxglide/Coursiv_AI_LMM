EXAMPLE: 

Let's look at this case: your child's birthday is in three weeks, and you want to use ChatGPT to plan the event. You have:
A guest list in Excel
Venue quotes in your email
Theme inspiration screenshots on your phone
A dozen text threads with your co-parent about the budget

With so many inputs, you definitely need to develop a multi-step plan.

-----
Projects solve this by creating a dedicated space where ChatGPT remembers your progress, stores your files, and follows your specific instructions — across multiple conversations.
