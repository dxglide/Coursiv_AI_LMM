ChatGPT operated on different models. If you've tried it before, you might've seen models like GPT-3, o-3, GPT-4, and so on.
Each model was best at its specific field: some at writing, some at coding, some were fast, some took their time to respond.

However, since then, ChatGPT has started operating on its single most powerful model by default. Currently, this model is GPT-5.2.


For quick, straightforward tasks, Instant Mode is your best choice. It prioritizes speed and delivers results without additional questions.
Instead, Thinking Mode is specifically designed for advanced, multi-step tasks that require reasoning and synthesis.

** n fact, ChatGPT can recognize task complexity automatically in Auto Mode — it decides whether to use "Instant" or "Thinking" based on your request.

In a nutshell, think of the ChatGPT modes as different engines:
"Instant" is built for speed
"Thinking" is built for complex tasks
"Auto" is a default mode, where ChatGPT decides itself


Looking at the above screenshot, which ChatGPT feature would be most helpful for the complex interview prep task we discussed earlier?

Select all possible answers


It's designed for intensive academic or knowledge work

It's an advanced feature that's difficult to use

It takes significantly longer than Web Search
Correct answer
Deep Research handles complex analysis over time — think academic papers or comprehensive reports. For quick company info, Web Search is faster and sufficient.



----------------
Web Search, as mentioned above, pulls current information from the internet — news, company updates, and recent developments.
It's perfect for: company research, current events, and recent product launches.

------------
Deep Research is built for long, comprehensive, multi-source analysis. It examines dozens of sources, synthesizes findings, and produces detailed reports.

-----
Agent Mode lets ChatGPT execute multi-step workflows autonomously — it can search the web, analyze results, create documents, and iterate without constant input from you.
It's like giving ChatGPT a project brief instead of step-by-step instructions. It plans and executes the workflow independently.
-------

Add Photos & Files lets you upload images (PNG, JPG, PDF) and documents (Word, Excel, text files) for ChatGPT to analyze, summarize, or reference.
Examples: upload a resume to edit it; upload an Excel sheet to analyze; upload a screenshot to extract text from it; and many more.

----
Beyond processing images, ChatGPT can also Create Images. Describe what you need visually, and ChatGPT generates it.
Use this for: portfolio visuals, brand logos, presentation graphics, social media visuals, or just for fun.
